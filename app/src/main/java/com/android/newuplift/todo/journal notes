Database helper - this is a class extends to SQLiteHelper class , which helps me create the tables
and the database

QuoteDAO - db operations simplified

DataClasses kt file - is where i keep data classes

FavoriteQuotesFragment - this fragments displays the quotes it queries , i made a manager or DAO
to do operations sa db , it use recycle view to display it

HomeFragment  - Where i generate quotes simple UI


Classes used to Communicate to API QuoteSlate

QuotableAPI
RetrofitClient

This fetch a JSON object using API and desrialized it using a data class made to match the JSON


I made the AuthManager this uses sharedPreferences para na koy track sa akong currentID
the point of this was so i can query accordingly sa users with respect to its fav quotes

In branch login, i had a lot of changes that includes the additon of foriegn key in quotes table
changed my DAO accordinly and so

basta halos tanan to blue so big overhaul.

Now ill be making the log out ,

I have finished implementing the logout , i used a custom dialog murag alert sa java,
it pops up when i press log out and if i press yes it redirects me to the log out activity
and i also called the function logout to the AuthManager a singleton that keeps track to my currentID and
login status

it works so far , each user has its own favorites

The next i want to implement would be polishing some features , that would be the profile fragment

I also encountered not compatible , which is my current theme is Material and the
backgrounds i did is appcompat so , work around is use material components or
change the theme
